DevTodo2
========
DevTodo2 is a command-line task management utility. Tasks are hierarchically
organised, have priorities, and track creation and completion time.

Task lists are stored in the current directory as the file ``.todo2``.

For much more complete information please refer to the man page (todo2(1)).

Installing
----------
DevTodo2 is written in `Go <http://golang.org>`_. To install, you will
need Go 1 or a release candidate.

Once you have Go installed and your ``GOPATH`` set, do the following::

  $ go get github.com/droundy/goopt
  $ git clone git://github.com/alecthomas/devtodo2.git
  $ cd devtodo2
  $ make install

This will install to ``/usr/local`` by default, but that can be overridden by
passing ``prefix=<dir>`` to ``make``. The installation directories can be
further customized by setting ``bindir=<dir>``, ``mandir=<dir>`` and
``man1dir=<dir>`` which default to ``$(prefix)/bin``, ``$(prefix)/share/man``
and ``$(mandir)/man1``, respectively.

**NOTE:** You can also install with::

  $ go get github.com/alecthomas/devtodo2

But the binary will be named ``devtodo2`` and the man page will not be
installed.

DevTodo1?
---------
Yes, this is version 2. `Version 1 <http://swapoff.org/devtodo1.html>`_ was written in
C++ in 2004, and has been due for a rewrite for a *very* long time.

Differences between version 1 and 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features:

- Task lists are now stored as JSON.
- Everything is a *lot* faster.
- Much less code.

Not currently supported:

- Filters. Completed tasks are hidden by default, but may be displayed with ``-A``.
- Linked files.
- ``~/.todorc`` configuration file.
- Colour customisation.
- Custom task formatting.

How do I import my version 1 task lists?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DevTodo2 will load your old ``.todo`` files automatically. If you modify the
task list with DevTodo2 it will transparently migrate the file to ``.todo2`` in
the new format.

You can specify the version 1 filename to load with
``--legacy-file=<filename>``, and the version 2 filename with
``--file=<filename>``.
